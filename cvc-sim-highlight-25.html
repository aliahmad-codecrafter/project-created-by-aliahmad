                    University of Northern British C program, provides upskilling
                    opportunities for nurses from northern and Indigenous communities. This initiative
                    addresses healthcare workforce shortages, improves care in underserved regions, and
                    supports professional growth among Indigenous and northern students. By investing in
                    nursing education, we contribute to the personal advancement of nurses while bolstering
                    healthcare access and resilience in these communities.</p></div>
