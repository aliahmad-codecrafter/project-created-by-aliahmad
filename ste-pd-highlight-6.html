 MA COB achievement of Zero Routine Hydrocarbon Venting in 2024 is a key milestone in our NZCE journey. This has resulted in a significant GHG emissions reduction of over 9MMtCO2e per annum (up to 2023), contributing to more than 80% reduction of methane emissions.
This brings us one step closer in meeting our goal of Upstream annual GHG emission cap at 11.6MMtCO2e by 2024 and 50% reduction of methane emissions by 2025 from 2019 baseline.
In 2023, we have reduced Upstream's emissions by 17% in Malaysia operated assets through completion of 6 GHG emissions reduction projects:
• Angsi C Solar (power system installation)
• Samarang Ph3 & Samarang Ph4 (vent recovery)
• Baronia flare gas recovery
• Temana Vent to Flare
• Bayan Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU)
As of Q3 2024 a total of 5 GHG emissions reduction projects has been completed and contributed to 10% reduction in overall Malaysia operated assets
• TGAST Bypass & Blending
• Dulang A21S Gas Injection Improvement
• Angsi E Solar & Wind Power Installation
• Erb West Phase 2 Achieve Zero Continuous Flaring with FVI <009 (KNEW)
• D18 Scrubber Upgrade
